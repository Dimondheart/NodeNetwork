This method uses nodes and connections between nodes, similar to a linked list.  However there are important differences between Nodes with Node Networks and linked lists, including:

- Nodes can form complex networks of links that would be impractical in a regular linked list
- Node Networks provide a mix of linked-list-like and grid/array-like behavior
- Nodes and Node Networks are designed to be processed as a complex web of data and algorithms, vs a linked list or grid/array which are geared more towards storing data that can be accessed or iterated over
